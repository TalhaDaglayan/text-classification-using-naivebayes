# Text Classification using Naive Bayes

This project implements text classification using Naive Bayes classifier in Python. It includes training data for four categories: "Sports", "Politics", "Health", and "Science", and provides a method to classify text documents into these categories. 

## Introduction
Text classification, also known as text categorization, is the process of assigning pre-defined categories or labels to text documents based on their content. In this project, we use the Naive Bayes classifier, a popular probabilistic classifier, to classify text documents into four different categories.

## Dataset
The training data consists of text documents from four different categories:
- "Sports"
- "Politics"
- "Health"
- "Science"

The training data is used to train the Naive Bayes classifier, which learns the statistical properties of each category from the provided text documents. Additionally, a separate test dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the classifier.

## Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- MatPlotLib
